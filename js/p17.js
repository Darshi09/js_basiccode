// Write a JavaScript code snippet that uses arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to determine if a number is both even and greater than 10. Display the result using console.log.

let num = 12; 
if (num > 10 && num % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(num + " is even and greater than 10.");
} else {
    console.log(num + " does not follow the condition.");
}

// 12 is even and greater than 10.
